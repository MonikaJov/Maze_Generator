Computer graphics project made using OpenGL. Generates a 3D maze using a depth-first search algorithm

Used software tools:

-OpenGL

-CLion

-Used programming language: C++

To create the maze I used the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm by taking random steps and "collapsing" the wall between them to create a path. The player can move through the maze using the keys: W, S, A and D and browse by moving the mouse.

Installation Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

CMake version 3.12 or higher installed, C++ Compiler installed, CLion installed. To set up the project and play the game, follow these steps:
